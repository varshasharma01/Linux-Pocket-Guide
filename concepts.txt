Introduction ~

Before moving on to the LINUX lets have a small talk ☕️
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
Lets take a look at 1969 its time when ken Thompson and Dennnis Ritchie created unix operating system it was all good but it had one problem the 
source code was owned by AT and T company when some other created their own software distribution based on unix AT and T sues them this led to the 
limitations to the development. 

To encounter this problen in year 1983 Richard Stallman created GNU( it literally means not unix 😂) project intended to make free and open source 
replacement to unix in 1992 it included linux under GNU project under general public license, linux was created in 1991 by linus Torwalds a 
kernel which act as a mediater between hardware and applications, user interact with kernel with the help of shell through command line. in GNU's 
upcomming years it created many tools and applications like tar, bash just the name of few which can be used by linux kernel that let to revolution 
in software world.

As it gave freedom to developers tonnes of developers made their contributions and created thousand of linux distro. A distro is a complete operating
system based on linux kernel which comes with linux kernel packages package-manager Graphic-user-interface. The family tree of linux is huge 
but have one thing in common - the seed of linux with tools, utilities and freedom provided by GNU.

We use shell to communicate with kernel, which communicates with hardware so, we indirectly communicate with the hardware using shell
The user cannot communicate with shell using magical spells 😂 hence the user interact with UI(user Interface) to communicate and interact.
There are mainly two types of User interface -  1.command line user interface 2.Graphic user interface 
The GUI uses the graphics while the CLI uses the commands aka instructions. 

Now a questions may arise in your mind I have not encountered the command line user interface while using apps like file manager 
The thing is the those apps are interacting with shell for you under the hood while you use the app. 

To communicate and use the services we have to communicate with shell, as shell is CLI we will be exploring commands and concepts. 

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Commands: syntax and type 

Syntax:
You may notice that the instructions have a multiple parts these parts can be divided into three parts 
1.command
2.options 
3.arguments
Syntax: command option argument 

Type:
Commands can be divided into two main type
1.Builtin - alreaady defiled in your system 
2.External - not defined by the system but defined by the user 

👨🏽‍💻usage:To know type of command 
👨🏽‍💻type:type command 
👨🏽‍💻example:type echo

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Shell

As we discussed earlier we need to interact to with shell via commands so, lets start the shell topic 😉

There are different types of shell available exmaple bash(Bourne Again Shell) shell, corn shell, z shell, bourne shell (ment for unix) and many more these shells are different and may serve special purpose in specific fields, but all of them have one thing in common that they all act as a medium to interact with kernel. 

👨🏽‍💻usage:To know which shell we are working with 
👨🏽‍💻type:echo $SHELL
👨🏽‍💻output:/bin/bash OR /bin/zsh OR /bin/ksh OR any other shell that have been installed onto your system.  

👨🏽‍💻usage:To change shell         note: they must be installed in your system 
👨🏽‍💻type:chsh -s /bin/[ code name of the shell you wanna switch note: these square brackets are not needed these are just for instructing purpose]
👨🏽‍💻output:No effect but the shell will be changed but it will came into effect after you close the current session and start a new one.
👨🏽‍💻example:chsh -s /bin/bash

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

kernel ~

Kernel is major component of an opreating system its sits between hardware and applications/processes it manages resources as efficient as possible 
Kernel carries out four major tasks 

1.Memory management 
2.Process management 
3.Device drivers 
4.System calls and security

The linux kernel is monolithic it means it carries out multiple tasks all by itself.
The linux kernel is modular it means it can extend its capiblities using dynamicially loaded kernel modules.

Lets check about kernel info 

👨🏽‍💻usage:To know the kernel info
👨🏽‍💻type:echo uname

👨🏽‍💻usage:To know the kernel info including the major version and minor version and patch release 
👨🏽‍💻type:echo uname -a 
👨🏽‍💻example of a output: 4.15.0-72-generic 
The first number tells about the current version
The second number tells about the major version
The third number tells about patch release 
The fourth word tells about the type of the kernel this is distro specific 

Kernel and user space ~

The memory is divided into two parts 1.kernel space and user space 
Kernel space is composed of device drivers and kernel they have unrestricted acecess to the hardware to kernel items like kernel code kernel 
extensions which executes and provides it services
User space is the second component of the main memory it have restricted acces to the hardware it comes with all kind of tools and programming 
languages graphical tools and other things like java ruby c python and docker containers etc.
All user programs function by manipulating data which comes from hardware like disk, user programs made special request to the kernel call system 
calls example open or write a file etc, this system call make kernel to provide resourcs to program. 

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Command line help ~

👨🏽‍💻usage:To know about the flags of the command  
👨🏽‍💻type:COMMAND --help

👨🏽‍💻usage:To know about the commmand 
👨🏽‍💻type:man COMMAND
👨🏽‍💻More:There are chances that there are more than one type of documentation of a single command in that case provide the section like ~ man 1,2 command 
These section type can be seen by typing man man command 

👨🏽‍💻usage:To get command from the little description  
👨🏽‍💻type:apropos SMALL-DESCRIPTION
👨🏽‍💻More:This command may print extra stuff like manuall of other utilities that contain the description provided to make this more reliable for 
this -s flag is used for sections for example the command manualls are found from section 1 to 8 so the more reliable way to find connad is 
apropos -s 1,8 SMALL-DESCRIPTION

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Linux boot sequence ~
Although you have have booted your system and are working on it 🌚 lets discusss a steps involved in this task 

Linux boot sequence can be divided into four major groups ~
1. BIOS post
2. GRUB loader/ Boot loader 
3. Kernel initilization
4. INTIT process (systemd)

BIOS POST ~
POST(Power On Self Test) in this stage BIOS runs a post test to insure that all the hardware components attached to the device are working correctly
if POST fails compuetr may not be operatble and computer will not move to second step of boot process. 

Boot loader ~
After the POST sequence BIOS load and executes the boot code from the hard disk of the boot device, located in the first sector of the hard disk  
In linux this code os located in the /boot file system The boot loader provide user with the boot screen often  with multiple os to boot into.
Once the choice is provided the boot loader loades the kernel into the memory. Supplying with parameters and handling the control to the kernel 
Example of the boot loader is GRUB 2(Grand Unified Boot Loader version 2) it is primary boot loader for most of the linux distributions.

Kernel Initilization ~
The kernel loaded into the memory is usually decompressed then the kernel loads into the memory and starts executing during this time kernel carries 
out tasks such as initilizing hardware, cpu sheduling and memory management etc.

INIT ~
When the kernel gets compleateately operational kernel goes for INIT process, this process sets up user space and processes needed for user environment.

In most of the linux distributions INIT process later calls the systemd, it is responsible for bringing linux host into the useable space, mounting
filesystems starting and managing system services like systemd and sys5. Systemd has one advantage than sys5 is that it paralizes the services 
which are not necessary thus decreasing the startup time 

👨🏽‍💻usage:To know the the INIT process used 
👨🏽‍💻type:ls -l /sbin/init

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Package Manager ~

Package:
A package is a archive/files all the files that are required by a particular software. A package manager is a software that provides package + 
dependencies along with tasks like ~ Checking authenticity and integrity, Simplying the package management process, Grouping packages, Managing dependicies 

Every distributions may have a seperate package manager because distributions may differ in basic structure thus every different structure require 
different package manager Just like we talked earlier there are around a thousand of linux distributions but the big daddy of these distributions are 
DPKG/APT and RPM/YUM. DPKG is used by linux os like ubantu, debian, arch linux linux mint etc. RPM is used bu RHEL,fedora,cent os etc. The most usual package 
manager used by mac os is home brew. 

RPM(red hat package manager) ~

                                   --------------------------------------------
                                   |  install   |   rpm -ivh packagename.rpm  |
                                   |  unistall  |   rpm -e packagename.rpm    |
                                   |  upgrade   |   rpm -Uvh packagename.rpm  |
                                   |  query     |   rpm -q packagename.rpm    |
                                   |  verify    |   rpm -Vf path-to-file      |
                                   --------------------------------------------

YUM(yellow dog updater modifier) ~

Despite all of these RPM does not manage dependencies by itself so we need a better package manager hopefully there a package manager called YUM this 
package manager works on RPM based distros It is a high level package manager but still works with RPM under the hood. YUM deals with automatic 
dependencies management. 

To install dependencies it works with dependencies packages they may stored on local or are available on remote server accessed via server protocalls.
In your loacal system you can find those dependicies file on etc/yum.repos.d/dependencies-files you can adde any dependicies file here in case you wanna 
install unofficial updates of any modifications.

👨🏽‍💻usage:To list all the installed repos
👨🏽‍💻type:yum repolist

👨🏽‍💻usage:To find what dependencies is provided to a application 
👨🏽‍💻type:yum provides DESIRED-SERVICE-OR-UTILITY 

                                   ----------------------------------------------
                                   |  install   |   yum install packagename     |
                                   |  unistall  |   yum remove packagename      |
                                   |  update    |   yum update packagename      |
                                   ----------------------------------------------

Steps involved in installing a package ~
yum first checks the transaction check it check repositories of that package it also check if any of the dependincy package installed in system 
or it needs to be upgraded. After all that it displays transaction summary and asks the choice to further go on. After that choice yum downloads 
the packages.

DPKG(debian package manager) ~

                                   --------------------------------------------
                                   |  install   |   dpkg -i packagename.deb   |
                                   |  unistall  |   dpkg -r packagename.deb   |
                                   |   list     |   dpkg -l packagename       |
                                   |  status    |   dpkg -s packagename       |
                                   |  verify    |   dpkg -p path to package   |
                                   --------------------------------------------

Just like RPM it does not handle dependencies on its own so a better package manager is required just like YUM which works with dpkg under the hood.

apt(advance package manager) ~
To install dependencies it can be done by packages stored on local or it may install from remote server by connection using server protocalls its 
packages can be find at /etc/sources.list/ 

                                   ---------------------------------------------------
                                   |  install        |   apt install packagename     |
                                   |  unistall       |   apt remove packagename      |
                                   |  referesh repo  |   apt update                  |
                                   | install upgrade |   apt upgrade                 |
                                   |  search         |   apt search packagename      |
                                   |  upgrade 2.0    |   apt edit-sources            |
                                   ---------------------------------------------------

File 

Types ~

There's a commom phrase in linux that everything is a file so it is necessary to get really handy on em' 


                                                                         Files

File in linux are divided into 3 types 
1.Regular
2.Directory
3.Special

1.Regular files are the most basic files in linux they are data files or media files or scripts 

2.Directories are the files that store other files or directories 

3.Special files are further divided into 5 types 

3.1 Character files - these files represent devices under /dev that allows OS to communicate with IO devices   example - mouse

3.2 Block files - These files represent block devices under /dev a block device read from and write in block/chunk of data  example - hard disk, ram 

3.3 Links - these files are the way to associate two or more file name with same set of file data there are two types of links 

3.3.1 Hard Link - two or more files name that share the same block of data on a physical disk although they behave as a independent files deleting one 
link will delete the data 

3.3.2 Soft link - They act as pointers to another files deleting a soft link will not delete the actual file 
Soft link and hardlink 

File points to the inode and innode points to the group of data. There might be chances that one or more that one person wanna access same data 
but might lie in different directories in that case the one usual way is to copy all the data form orignal to source that will result in storage
blunder in that case links are highly useful one or more user can have access to same data without blundering the storage 

👨🏽‍💻usage:To create a hard link
👨🏽‍💻type:ln PATH_TO_OLD_DATA PATH_TO_NEW_LINK
👨🏽‍💻output:Link will be created but its hard manipulation of data on one side will not result in changes on both sides, talking about how it workds
both the names points to same inode, hardlink limitations are ~ Hard links can only be formed for files not directories, file system dependincy

Soft link points to the path to the file all the stuff for making soft link is almost same but with a difference of -s flag
to view the true path of the link created readlink command is used permissions of softlink are kinda useless 

3.4 Socket - These file enable communication between two processes 

3.5 named pipes - These files are allows one process as the input to another Data flow in pipe is unidirectional 

File types and their identifiers 

  |------------------------------------|

/bin ~ This file contains the basic executeable linux shell commands like ps chmod etc 
/boot ~ This directory contains the files related to system like boot loader, kernel and boot image etc.
/dev ~ This directory this directory contains the dvice files 
/etc ~ This directory contains the most important access control files like passwd sudoers profile.d environment limits.config etc 
/home ~ This directory contains the user home directory 
/lib ~ This directory contains the system libraries like java perl frameworks
/media ~ All the removable media that is being plugged shows in this directory media is mpunted automaticially
/mnt ~ mnt is used by system administrators to mount the files 
/opt ~ This directory is used to store third party softwares 
/tmp ~ This directory contains the temporary files 
/usr ~ This directory contains the user programs 
/var ~ This directory contains the variable files 
/sbin ~ This directory contains the system binaries 

There are two types of path one is relative path second is absolute path. Relative path is just path of file inside the currect working directory 
while absolute path include all the ancestors of the current working directory.

👨🏽‍💻usage:To check the file type 
👨🏽‍💻type:file FILENAME-INCLUDING-FILE-FORMAT-IF-PRESENT

👨🏽‍💻usage:To create a file 
👨🏽‍💻type:touch FILE-NAME.FILE-FORMAT

👨🏽‍💻usage:To go directly to home directory 
👨🏽‍💻type:     cd      cd ~      cd $HOME   

👨🏽‍💻usage:To check the current directory you are on 
👨🏽‍💻type:pwd

👨🏽‍💻usage:To list the content of current working directory
👨🏽‍💻type:ls
👨🏽‍💻note:Multiple options can be used with this command like l for long list a for mentioning hidden files r for reverse order example ls -la

👨🏽‍💻usage:To switch to another directory present in the current working directory 
👨🏽‍💻type:cd DIRECTORY-NAME

👨🏽‍💻usage:To switch to parent of the current working directory  to traverse back of the hiearchy
👨🏽‍💻type:cd ..

👨🏽‍💻usage:To create directory
👨🏽‍💻type:mkdir DIRECTORY-NAME-AS-PER-AS-YOUR-CHOICE

👨🏽‍💻usage:To delete directory
👨🏽‍💻type:rm -r DIRECTORY-NAME-YOU-WANNA-DELETE

👨🏽‍💻usage:To copy a file or directory
👨🏽‍💻type:cp loation of the file which is to be copied location of parent directory where it is to be copied 
👨🏽‍💻output:The file or dictory will be copied at the same time 
👨🏽‍💻example:cp a/b/c/d  /a/b/c/
👨🏽‍💻note: There might be a case when there are so much directory/file under the copying directory/file in that case -r can be used.

👨🏽‍💻usage:To move a file or directory
👨🏽‍💻type:mv loation of the file which is to be transfered location of parent directory where it is to be transfered
👨🏽‍💻output:The file or dictory will be moved at the same time 
👨🏽‍💻example:rmdir mv a/b/c/4  /1/2/3/
👨🏽‍💻note: If the both location are same but the file name is different in that case the moving file or directory will be renamed as per as second name

👨🏽‍💻usage:To view the meta data of the file 
👨🏽‍💻type:stat FILENAME.FILEFORMAT

Console base text editors and viewers 

* Pagers are used to view multiple text pages at a time 
* less and more are some of the pagers that are easily found in every linux distro  

👨🏽‍💻usage:To open document with the less pager 
👨🏽‍💻type:less FILENAME.FILEFORMAT
👨🏽‍💻note: Use arrow key to traverse up and down 
👨🏽‍💻note: Use /SERACH-DATA to search the data in that file to remove the case sensitivity press i 
👨🏽‍💻note: press q to quit 

👨🏽‍💻usage:To open document with the more pager 
👨🏽‍💻type:more FILENAME.FILEFORMAT
👨🏽‍💻note: Use spacebar to traverse up and down 
👨🏽‍💻note: press q to quit 

👨🏽‍💻usage:To see the contents of a file in vi editor 
👨🏽‍💻type:vi FILENAME.FILEFORMAT
👨🏽‍💻note: To search the text use /SEARCH-DATA to search the data in editor to remove its case sensitivity use /SEARCH-DATA\c

The legendary vi editor have three modes 
Command - the default mode in vi editor is command move we can type command such as cp mv etc 
Insert  - this mode allows us to edit data aka add test delete text 
Last line - After getting our work done press esc key and : to switch to last line ~~ the escape key makes user go into command mode and :
takes user to last line. after reaching the last line we have options either to save/discard and exit vi editor 

Command mode : 
Press escape key for entering into command mode 
Lets gets handy with the comand mode ~
arrow up/k     for cursor up 
arrow down/j   for cursor down
arrow left/h   for cursor left 
arrow right/l  for cursor right
To copy and paste a line just press y two times on the first alphabet of the desired line and press p on desired place where you want to paste it.
To delete a letter just press x on the highlighted cursor
To delete the desired line just press d two times on the first alphabet of that line 
To delete the number of lines including the current type d n d   (n is the number of lines)
To redo the task press ctrl+r 
To undo the task press u 
To move cursor to the searched or desired part press /sequence-of-Character to search pattern above type ?sequence-of-Character
To find the above pattern above he current line press N and for the below press n

Insert mode :
Press i to enter into insert mode or o or a 
To make any changes first going into command mode is necessary 
To save the changes after editing press ~ escape : w
To save the changes and extit press ~ escape : wq 
To exit without making changes press ~ escape : q !
To search text use /STRING type of syntax 
To search despite case sensitiveness use /STRING\c syntax 
To reach specific line press esc :LINE-NUMBER


Standard Data streams and data manipulation @i/o 

* A Linux stream is data traveling in a Linux shell from one process to another through a pipe, or from one file to another as a redirect.
* Streams can travel through several Linux stream-pipe connections of incremental commands to accomplish administrative tasks.
* Standard streams are interconnected input output communication channels 
* Standard input -> All the data that are given via shell aka input 
* Standard output -> All the output generated and displayed onto the console 
* Standard error -> All the error generated 
* The data in these streams can be redirected it means the destination of the data flowing in these streams can be changed 
* Input output can be redirected with the help of 1> opreator [> for overwrite and >> for append]
* Error data stream can be redirected with the help of 2> 
* Input during the run time of the program can be redirected with the help of < example INPUT-NEEDING-COMMAND < FILENAME.FILEFORMAT
* To redirect the errors and the output use > as regular but in the end of the file use 2>&1
* We can use pipes to manipulate the data to be output example cat file.txt | sort 
* are are tonnes of sort kinda utilities example column -t , uniq (remove adjacent duplicates)
* sed is the steram editor it can be used to replace the data 
* cut can be used to extract data from the file 
* diff is the command line utility to compare the files 


                                                            Standard data Streams
                                                                     |
                                                                     |

                                              |                      |                     |
                                              |                      |                     |
                                        Standard Input        Standard output         Standard Error


👨🏽‍💻usage:Example of input output redirection 
👨🏽‍💻:Suppose there are two files file1.txt and file2.txt, to simply redirect the input to the file1.txt ~ cat "HELLO" > file1.txt 
now the file1.txt have HELLO as its data we can output this data to the console ~ cat file1.txt , now we want to redirect the output 
of the data of file1.txt to file2.txt ~ cat file1.txt >> file2.txt, suppose we made a typo during the cat file1.txt as cat file.txt 
the error will be generated ~ cat: file.txt: No such file or directory , we can redirect this error by using 2 before the diamond operator 
~ cat file.txt 2>>  file2.txt , now if we output the conent of the file 2 it would be 
HELLO
cat: file.txt: No such file or directory

👨🏽‍💻usage:To check the status of te command last input
👨🏽‍💻type:echo $?

Here are some of the value related to the errors that can be generated by the error stream 
0: success
1: generic or unspecified error
2: missing command or file
126: permission problem or command is not executable
127: command not found
128: invalid argument to exit command
130: command terminated by signal
137: command terminated by a signal with a value of 9 (usually means the command was killed)
139: segmentation fault or invalid memory reference
141: pipe broken

👨🏽‍💻usage:To output the data of the file top to bottom 
👨🏽‍💻type:cat FILENAME.FILEFORMAT

👨🏽‍💻usage:To output the data of the file bottom to top
👨🏽‍💻type:tac FILENAME.FILEFORMAT

👨🏽‍💻usage:To print the first n lines of the file 
👨🏽‍💻type:head -n NUMBER-OF-LINES FILENAME.FILEFORMAT

👨🏽‍💻usage:To print the last n lines of the file 
👨🏽‍💻type:tail -n NUMBER-OF-LINES FILENAME.FILEFORMAT

👨🏽‍💻usage:To replace data with newdata
👨🏽‍💻type:sed 's/DATA/NEWDATA/g' FILENAME.FILEFORMAT 
👨🏽‍💻:Use -i (--in-place) to edit the file at the same time 

👨🏽‍💻usage:To extract data from the file 
👨🏽‍💻type:cut -d 'DELIMETER' -f NUMBER-OF-FIELD FILENAME.FILEFORMAT 

👨🏽‍💻usage:To find the difference between files 
👨🏽‍💻type:diff file1 file2 
👨🏽‍💻:Identical lines are not shown here 
👨🏽‍💻: To get the good view use -c flag using this the same lines are shown normally while other with ! prefix
👨🏽‍💻: -y flag can be used for side by side comparison 
👨🏽‍💻:using sdiff the changed lines are marked with pipe
👨🏽‍💻:1c1 kinda words will appear these tells us that line 1 on file 1 has been changed on line 1 file 2 
👨🏽‍💻: < This tells us that the content appear only in first file whle > telle us only exist only in another file


File permissions

                                                               File permissions
                                                                        |
                                       ------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                       |                      |                           |                   |
                                       |                      |                           |                   |
                                     Read(4)               Write(3)                   Execute(1)          SGID & SUID

* Action on files can be done by user, group and others. Actions include reading, writing and execution if possible.
* The permissions of the file can be modified by the user who owns it.
* chmod is the command line utility to manipulate the file permissions 

👨🏽‍💻usage:To modify permissions of the file  
👨🏽‍💻type:chmod USER--WHOSE-PERMISSIONS-ARE-MODIFIED+/-PERMISSIONS FILENAME.FILEFORMAT
👨🏽‍💻output:Permissions will be modified 
👨🏽‍💻example:chmod u+rwx nuclearcodes.txt
👨🏽‍💻note:Taking example of the above command this + represent that permissions are provided in case of removal of permissions - is used, similarly 
in the above example u represent the user aka whose permissions are modified this can also be group represented by g or others represented by o or 
can be together at the same time. example chmod go+rwx nuclearcode.txt these permissions cab be grouped by using a comma example ~
chmod g+rwx,o-rwx,u+rwx nuclearcodes.txt 

There if you wanna apply same permissions to all types of account at the same ti e use octal example ~
chmod 777 FILENAME.FILEFORMAT       to provide read write and execute permissions to all kinds of account 
chmod 555 FILENAME.FILEFORMAT       to provide read and execute permissions to all kinds of account 
chmod 660 FILENAME.FILEFORMAT       to provide read and write access to owner and no access to others 
chmod 750 FILENAME.FILEFORMAT       to provide all permissions to user and read and write permissions to group and no permissions to other 

In all of these when there are set where the file is executed, it will be exeuted as the owner or group set not by the person who is executing
SUID (Single user identification bit)
All of these are set up like normal permissions but there's an extra digit at the front  
SUID         4      s 
SGID         2      s
Sticky bit   1      t
Sticky bit are usually set on directories that are shared between people 
Setting sticky bit on the directory only user can manipulate all the stuff of the directory
These special permissions can be set using the following synatx 
chmod u+s FILE for SUID
chmod g+s FILE for SGID
chmod o+t FILE for Sticky bit  

File ownership ~ 

👨🏽‍💻usage:To change the ownership to the user and the group of the file 
👨🏽‍💻type:chown user-to-transer-ownership:group-to-transfer-ownership  FILENAME.FILEFORMAT
👨🏽‍💻output:Ownership will be provided to the provided user and group 
👨🏽‍💻example:chown India:asia nuclearcodes.txt

👨🏽‍💻usage:To change the user ownership of the file 
👨🏽‍💻type:chown new-user FILENAME.FILEFORMAT
👨🏽‍💻output:User will also get the ownership of the file and the ownership of the group remain default
👨🏽‍💻example:chown India nukes.txt

👨🏽‍💻usage:To change group ownership of the file 
👨🏽‍💻type:chgrp group-name FILENAME.FILEFORMAT
👨🏽‍💻output:Ownership the file will be changed to the group-name provided
👨🏽‍💻example:chgrp asia India
👨🏽‍💻Note:We can only change the group ownership of the file of those groups that user(owner) is part of 

Search data in files 

* grep is a comma line utility to search for data in files 

👨🏽‍💻usage:To search data in file 
👨🏽‍💻type: grep 'DATA' /DIRECTORY/FILENAME.FILEFORMAT
👨🏽‍💻note: -i flag can be use to ignore case 
👨🏽‍💻note: -r flag can be used for searching in sub directories recursively 
👨🏽‍💻note: -v flag can be used for verbose(invert) results 
👨🏽‍💻note: -w flag can be used for searching only for words 
👨🏽‍💻note: -o flag can be used for only for resultant
 
👨🏽‍💻usage:To print the n number of lines above the desired index being completely independent of the pattern searched including the searched data
👨🏽‍💻type:grep -a(NUMBER-OF-LINES-YOU-WANNA-PRINT-ABOVE) data FILENAME.FILEFORMAT

👨🏽‍💻usage:To print the n number of lines below the desired index being completely independent of the pattern searched including the searched data
👨🏽‍💻type:grep -b(NUMBER-OF-LINES-YOU-WANNA-PRINT-BELOW) data FILENAME.FILEFORMAT

Search for files 

* Find is a command line utility to search file with tonnes of parameter options like format size type etc 
* -o flag can be used to make a or expression 
* -not flag can be used to make a not expression \!
* locate command succeed by FILENAME.FILEFORMAT can also be used for searching the files 

👨🏽‍💻usage:To search for a file 
👨🏽‍💻type: find /DIRECTORY-IN-WHICH-YOU-WANNA-SEARCH/ -name FILENAME.FILEFORMAT

Expressions to analyze text 

There may be chances that you require specifice text anatomy in that case expressions can be useful
Regs operators ~ | ^ $ . * + ? () {} [] [^] 
^ This can be used to search lines or word starting with the characters provided 
$ This can be used to search lines or word ending with the character provided
. This can be used as a character fill in the blank aka this . character between characters to search dots use \. aka escaping for searching 
multiple character in between use .*
* This can be used to check the character pre either omitted nonce to n times to prevent nonce use /+

File compression and archival 

File compression 

* Directories cannot be compressed thus we have to archive them to compress them 
* At least bzip gzip and xz file compressing utilities are found in every linux system 
* The file compressed using bzip2 will have .bz2 extention 
* The file compressed using gzip will have .gz extention 
* The file compressed using xz will have the .xz extention
* To decompress the file just used --decompress flag succeed with the compressed file or use selective utilities  
* While using these utilities orignial files are compressed to make them unaffected/make compressed file different use --keep flag 

👨🏽‍💻usage:To compress a file using bzip
👨🏽‍💻type:bzip2 FILENAME.FILEFORMAT

👨🏽‍💻usage:To decompress a bzip2 file 
👨🏽‍💻type:bunzip2 FILENAME.FILEFORMAT.bz2

👨🏽‍💻usage:To compress a file using gzip
👨🏽‍💻type:gzip FILENAME.FILEFORMAT

👨🏽‍💻usage:To decompress a file using gzip
👨🏽‍💻type:gunzip FILENAME.FILEFORMAT.gz

👨🏽‍💻usage:To compress a file using xz
👨🏽‍💻type:xz FILENAME.FILEFORMAT

👨🏽‍💻usage:To decompress a xz file 
👨🏽‍💻type:unxz FILENAME.FILEFORMAT.xz

File archival 

* tar is a command line utility to archive the data 
* The new archived file is called tarball 
* While using compression with archival the new name of the new tar file must succeed with the compression format used 
* It is adviced to used to use compression flag before the file flag

👨🏽‍💻usage:To archive data 
👨🏽‍💻type:tar -cf DESIRED-COMPRESSED-FINAL-FILE-NAME.tar file1 file2 file3 
👨🏽‍💻output:All data will be archived and made into a new file named given by you with an extension of .tar 
👨🏽‍💻note: -c option is used for compressing files and -f is used for specifying the name of compressed file  
👨🏽‍💻note: to view the content of the tarball use -tf flag combination succeed by the tarfile 
👨🏽‍💻note: -rf flad is same as -cf 
👨🏽‍💻note: -xf flag is used to extract the files 
👨🏽‍💻note: --directory succeed by the path to the desired directory  can be used to extract the content in the desired directory 
👨🏽‍💻note: use sudo to make sure the file permissions are preversed or -p flag can be used (--preserve-permissions)
👨🏽‍💻note: -a flag can be used for auto compress (--auto-compress)
👨🏽‍💻note: -z flag can be used for gzip compression with archival (--gzip)
👨🏽‍💻note: -j flag can be used for bzip2 compression with archival (--bzip2)
👨🏽‍💻note: -J flag can be used for xz compression with archival  (--xz)
👨🏽‍💻note: -Z flag can be used for compression with archival (--compress)

Users and Group Management 

Every Linux user have an account associated with it may also have a directory same as one's name under home directory. It also have a Unique ID and
a Group ID these GID and UID are used while creating and manipulating files. Similarly there are Groups in Linux which are just represent multiple 
users. For example if a new file is created by the user with group x all the member will be able to access that file.


Account in linux are mainly of 4 types ~


                                                                    Accounts types in linux

                                           Super User      Servive Accounts      System Accounts     User Accounts 



1.Super Accounts ~ This account have all the powers and the permissions of the system this is mostly known as root it have an UID = 0.
2.Service Accounts ~ These account are used by services.
3.System Accounts ~ These accounts are used by the system they have an UID of <100 or 500-1000.
4.User Accounts ~ These are the accounts used by the user


Quick notes ~ 

* All the details of the user are stored in /etc/passwd file.
* When the user is added to the system all the files form /etc/skel are copied to new user home directory.
* The defaults of can be explored under /etc/login.defs or by typing command useradd --defaults
* All the global environment variable are found under /etc/environment can be used by the new user as well
* Scripts presented in the /etc/profile.d will be executed every time user logins 
* User's limits to the system resources can be set by manipulating the file /etc/limits.config 
* When the user is added to the system a new group is also created and added to the system(same name as of user's) aka primary Group
* When a user is added his home directory is also created under home/
* To login new user must have a passwd this can set by typing passwd USER-NAME
* User can login by typing su USER-NAME and later entering the set passwd 
* usermod is the command line utility to modify user account settings 
* chage is the command line utility to manage user password 
* userdel is used to delete user-accounts 
* useradd is used to add user-accounts

We can put limits on users what and how much resources they can use To set such kinda limits we cvan edit limits.config file 
Usually there are four fields limits can be seen using ulimit -a command printing the various flags the limits can be set from these flags
for example to set limit on max user processes type ulimit -u NUMBER-OF-DESIRED-PROCESSES

domain - FOR WHOM LIMITS ARE FOR 
For users just simply type the name 
For groups use @ before group name 
For everyone use * this can be used as default limitatiins userlimit can override * limits 

type - WHAT TYPE OF LIMITS ARE IMPOSED these are of three types 
hard - this limit cannot be overridden by any user 
soft - User can increase its limits  
dash - This specifies this is both hard limit and soft limit 

item - ON WHAT ITEM LINITS ARE IMPOSED 
There are variety of items for example nproc aka maximum number of processes a user can run in current session nproc maxlogins
fsize aka maximum filesize created per session the value is in kilobytes 
cpu aka muximum time cpu can be used the value is in minutes 

value - HOW MUCH RESOURCE IS PROVIDED

Operations on operatring system 

Target 

* Systemd is the system and service manager for linux OS its not necessary that every system have systemd. Systemctl is the command line tool 
  used to manage systemd services. Location /usr/lib/
* Target in nutshell can be defined as the user interface implemented on the system or the interface OS boots into there are total 7 target 0 - 7t
  Runlevel 0  poweroff.target
  Runlevel 1  rescue.target
  Runlevel 2  runlevel2.target
  Runlevel 3  multi-user.target
  Runlevel 4  undefined
  Runlevel 5  graphical.target
  Runlevel 6  reboot.target

👨🏽‍💻usage:To manipulate the target from the command line 
👨🏽‍💻type:systemctl TARGET 
👨🏽‍💻note: poweroff and reboot can be use in place of the target in upper command and there might be need of --force flag, can also be used twice 
👨🏽‍💻note: To set the default target use set-default option succeed by target example systemctl set-default multiuser.target
👨🏽‍💻note: To shedule the shutdown and reboot type: shutdown TIME-IN-24-HOUR-FORMAT         timing limit 00:00 to 23:59
👨🏽‍💻note: To shutdown after n time type: shutdown +TIME-IN-MINUTES 
👨🏽‍💻note: To do reboot like shutdown just use -r option 
👨🏽‍💻note: To pass the message to user before the system boot off just type 'MESSAGE IN SINGLE QUOTES ' ex: shutdown 01:00 'System will at 1 o clock'

* Process is the exam in execution aka program in the memory that can be running or waiting it may accquire resources like cpu, io etc 
* Every process have its process id and parent process id init is the first process with pid 1
* kernel processes are wrapped in squarebrackets they run in the privilage area 
* Process niceness is the value how nice the process is to the other processes range -20 to 19
* Various signals can be given to processes to manipulate their state the signals will be applicable to process that are user related 
* There are various signals that are sent to processes

Shedule tasks

* crontab is one of the utilities that can be used to do repetative tasks but it is limited by power if the power goes off cron is un functional 
* in crontab full path is used to know the full path type which COMMAND
* To organize the task special directories can be used like /etc/cron.daily/  /etc/cron.hourly
* anacron is utility that can do task even if the power is off but it have a minimum time unit of day 
* The logs generated by crontab and anacrontab can be seen in /var/log/

👨🏽‍💻usage:To shedule tab using crontab of the user 
👨🏽‍💻type: crontab -e 
👨🏽‍💻note: The first five value represent time  6 represent user 7 command 
        first  - minute (0-59)

        fifth  - day of the week (0-6) where 0 is sunday 
        the * represent every value 
        the , can be used to add multipple time 6,9 
        the - can be used to specify range 6-9 the job will run on 6 7 8 9 the basic step is one unit /NUMBER can be used to add custom steps ex 6-9/2 
To list the current entries of the crontab -l flag can be used 
To edit the crontab of the another user use: crontab -e -u USERNAME 
To remove the crontab of the another user use: crontab -r -u USERNAME 

👨🏽‍💻usage:To shedule tab using anacrontab of the user 
👨🏽‍💻type:vi /etc/anacrontab
       first - Period (@daily @weekly @monthly)
       delay - in minutes how much time the job will wait to execute after boot 
       identifier - any name given to task which would be used for logs 
       command  - full path of command 
To check the wrong entries anacrontab -T can be used 

👨🏽‍💻usage:To list all the kernel runtime parameters
👨🏽‍💻type:sudo sysctl -a
👨🏽‍💻note: To write a value to parameter type: sysctl -w PARAMETER-NAME=VALUE , The value passed will be reset to default on reboot 
        To make changes presistent create a file /etc/sysctl.d/FILE-NAME-WITH-DOT-CONFIG-EXTENSION.config , now the file has been created just 
        type the PARAMETER-NAME=DESIRED-VALUE
        To read the file parameter instantly type: sysctl -p PATH-TO-PARAMETER-CONFIG-FILE
